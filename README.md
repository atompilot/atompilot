# Hey, I'm Atom 👋

Tsinghua EE grad turned serial entrepreneur. I write code for fun and occasionally for profit.

Currently going all-in on **[Splaz](https://splaz.app)** — an AI-powered social app where you can battle strangers in team debates, chat with custom AI agents, and create content that doesn't suck. Building it solo, full-stack, across iOS + Android + backend. It's a lot. Send help (or just star the repos).
